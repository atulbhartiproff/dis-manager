# Dis-Manager
## My first Discord bot

#### About it
The bot is made solely for the purpose o learning and innovating my skills and nothing else. The bot would be used on my own private servers for a day to day basis and not monetised. Its not worth all that.
Bot would be majorly in python for now but might change later

**Under Contsruction...**
I will update this regularly


## Token
Do not share the token with anybody else. As someone having that is the same as giving away your bot to anybody else. under no circumstance do share that.
After cloning the repositrpory
Change the following line in token.txt
 > Token here.

to the respective token of the bot.

## Features
- Works. That is a feature okay? Now shut up.

- Sends out random inspirational quotes after gaining request from an API that you can find in the code

- Can look through and detect if somebody has send a message including a certain sad phrase. Then it goes on to reply with any of the random consolation quote.

- Adding More soon...
